                    <h1 class="heading">Amortization Period</h1>
                    <p>An amortization period is essentially the length of time the mortgage payments are spread to calculate monthly payment. A fully amortized loan would be paid off at the end of this period, whereas a partially amortized loan would have a remainder or balloon payment at the end. Amortization period should not be confused with the term (or maturity as its commonly known). For example, a commercial mortgage can commonly have a 25-year amortization but a 10-year loan term or maturity.</p>
                    <p>This means that the payments for the mortgage will be spread over 25-years as if the loan were to be paid down to zero at the end of that period, but the actual loan would be called “due and payable” at the end of 10 years. Since the 25-year amortization period was not lived out, there is a remainder or balloon payment due to the lender.</p>
                    <p>Reducing the amortization period (whether lender determined based on comfort level, or borrower requested for a better deal) creates a higher mortgage payment. Since maximum loan amounts (LTV) is cash flow determined, this higher payment would negatively impact maximum loan amount qualification if the property is “cash flow restricted”.</p>
