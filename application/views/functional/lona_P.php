                <p>A commercial real estate debt fund is a private equity backed fund that pools individual investor capital and deploys that capital into commercial real estate debt opportunities.

Many funds specialize to go head-to-head with the most aggressive banks and institutions with more flexibility, while others may specialize in bridge loan products for example offering tailored and flexible loan terms with competitive market pricing.</p>
